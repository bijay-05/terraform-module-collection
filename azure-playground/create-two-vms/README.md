# Create Two Linux Virtual Machines
In this playground, we will create two linux virtual machines on azure cloud with Terraform.

## Points to consider
- Modules to organize resources that are repeated.
- Single resource group, virtual network, subnet and network security for both virtual machines.
- Separate network interfaces and public IP addresses for each virtual machine.
